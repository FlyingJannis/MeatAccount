# MeatAccount
![til](demo.gif)
Meat Account is a MUST HAVE for every flexitarian! Especially if:
- you would like to reduce your meat consumption,
- you see the problematic effects that our high meat consumption has on our climate, animal welfare (factory farming) or our own health,
- however, it is (still) difficult for you to completely give up meat.

That doesn't matter! Then Meat Account is exactly the right app for you!

Meat Account is your personal meat account that you carry in your pocket at all times!

So how does it work?
When you start Meat Account for the first time, you will be asked to create a virtual "meat account".
This means that you set yourself a fixed, maximum amount of meat (10 - 1000 gram), which is then paid into your account every week!
Now you can get started! Whenever you eat meat, you can enter the respective amount into your Meat Account super intuitively and easily and it will be debited from your account.
Due to the account principle, it is also possible to go into the red and exceed your weekly quota. In order to get back into the black, you can, for example, completely forgo meat for the next week.

Meat Account allows you to track your meat consumption very freely but nevertheless in a very targeted way and reduce it to your desired level.
In the statistics you can also see
- how much meat you consume on average per day
- what your last month looked like in terms of meat consumption
- an overview of your your current development with the help of beautiful graphs
- the impact your reduced meat consumption has on your personal ecological footprint, for example, compared to the average!

In Europe, the average person consumes just under 66 kilos of meat per year!
This corresponds to about 1.26 kilos per week!

Not everyone has to become a vegetarian in order to bring about a visibly positive change with regard to the currently far too high meat consumption in the world.
It's about being able to appreciate a good piece of meat again.

Meat Account gives you exactly this opportunity. And in addition to the decision:
- "I eat meat" and
- "I am a vegetarian"
  
you also have the option, for example:
- "I eat meat, but only a fixed amount per week".

Because every abstinence has an influence!
